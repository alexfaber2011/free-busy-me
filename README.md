# Calendar Gap Slim (v1)

This is, yet another, attempt at putting together calendar gap.  This time, a focus
will be on using tools that help get the job done quickly so that it can be
a proper proof of concept.

## Notes

### Firebase

#### Development

Project name: `calendar-gap-v1`.
_Note: I have other "calendar-gap" projects registered with google, so don't 
get those confused in the future_

App name: `calendar-gap-slim-v1`

##### Sign In Providers

Currently (11/14/2020), I'm making use of emai/password authentication so that
folks don't get confused when they eventually authorize calendar-gap to
read from multiple calendars.
